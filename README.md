# mypythonscripts

I am adding two simple scripts with name Task1.py and Task2.py. Each of the scripts perform different funtionality. 
Task1.py performs mathematical operations like addition, subraction, multiplication and division.
Task2.py it creates a greetings of each person by welcoming them.
Both the scripts takes inputs from users and delivers the output.
